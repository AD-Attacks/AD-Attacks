# ðŸ”¥ Introduction

C2 involves two main components: the command component and the control component.&#x20;

The command component refers to the attacker's or controller's system, typically a remote server or a compromised machine, from which they issue commands and instructions to the compromised systems or bots.&#x20;

The control component, on the other hand, comprises the compromised systems or bots that have been infected or compromised by the attacker's malware.

The C2 infrastructure can be set up using various communication channels and protocols, depending on the attacker's goals and the nature of the attack.

Our page explores a diverse array of popular C2 frameworks, including Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Empire, Covenant, Koadic, Faction, SilentTrinity, Pupy, Merlin, and Mythic.&#x20;

Each framework possesses unique features, communication channels, and integration options, catering to the specific needs and preferences of red team professionals.

Detection and mitigation of C2 infrastructure are essential in cybersecurity.&#x20;

Network security solutions and monitoring tools often employ various techniques to identify and block C2 communications, such as analyzing network traffic patterns, detecting known C2 signatures, or using machine learning algorithms to detect anomalous behavior.
