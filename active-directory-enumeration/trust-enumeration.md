# Trust Enumeration

## PowerView Enumeration

There are several trust types.

| **Trust Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Parent-child` | Domains within the same forest. The child domain has a two-way transitive trust with the parent domain.                                                                |
| `Cross-link`   | a trust between child domains to speed up authentication.                                                                                                              |
| `External`     | A non-transitive trust between two separate domains in separate forests which are not already joined by a forest trust. This type of trust utilizes SID filtering.     |
| `Tree-root`    | a two-way transitive trust between a forest root domain and a new tree root domain. They are created by design when you set up a new tree root domain within a forest. |
| `Forest`       | a transitive trust between two forest root domains.                                                                                                                    |

## PowerView Enumeration \[ User Hunting ]

### Find all machines on the current domain where the current user has local admin access

```powershell
Find-LocalAdminAccess -Verbose
```

### Find computers where a domain admin (or specified user/group) has sessions

```powershell
Invoke-UserHunter
Invoke-UserHunter -GroupName "RDPUsers"
```

### To confirm admin access

```powershell
Invoke-UserHunter -CheckAccess
```

### Find computers where a domain admin is logged-in

```powershell
Invoke-UserHunter -Stealth
```

### Find computers where a domain admin (or specified user/group) has sessions

```powershell
Find-DomainUserLocation -Verbose
Find-DomainUserLocation -UserGroupIdentity "StudentUsers"
```

### Find computers where a domain admin session is available and current user has admin access (uses Test-AdminAccess)

```powershell
Find-DomainUserLocation -CheckAccess
```

### Find computers (File Servers and Distributed File servers) where a domain admin session is available.

```powershell
Find-DomainUserLocation â€“Stealth
```
