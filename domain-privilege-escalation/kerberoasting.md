# ðŸŸ¢ Kerberoasting

### Understanding Kerberoasting

Kerberoasting is a type of cyber attack that targets the Kerberos authentication protocol widely utilized in Windows networks. It specifically aims to extract service account credentials by taking advantage of the way Kerberos handles service tickets.

When a user or service requests access to a resource from the Key Distribution Center (KDC), the KDC issues a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and subsequently a Service Ticket (ST) if access to a service is required. These tickets are encrypted with the service's password hash.

### **How Kerberoasting Works**

1. The attacker initially gains limited access to the network.
2. They request service tickets for various services on the network.
3. The service tickets, encrypted with the target service's password, are saved to the attacker's machine.
4. The attacker then attempts to offline-brute-force the encryption to reveal the service password.

### **Implications of Kerberoasting**

* **Credential Theft**: Successful Kerberoasting attacks compromise service account credentials that can have extensive privileges.
* **Lateral Movement**: Attackers can use the stolen credentials to move laterally within the network, accessing sensitive data and systems.
* **Persistent Access**: With service account credentials, attackers potentially maintain long-term access to the network.

### **Mitigation Strategies**

* Use strong, complex passwords for service accounts that are resistant to brute-force attacks.
* Regularly rotate service account passwords to limit the window of opportunity for attackers.
* Enable security features like Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) for detecting anomalous activities related to Kerberos authentication.

Network administrators must monitor for unusual service ticket requests and investigate any signs of Kerberoasting to protect network resources and sensitive information.

### Kerberoasting FAQ

#### **What is Kerberoasting?**

Kerberoasting is a cyberattack technique that exploits weaknesses in the Kerberos authentication protocol to steal password hashes of Active Directory user accounts. Attackers leverage these stolen hashes to crack passwords and gain unauthorized access to systems and data.

#### **How does Kerberoasting work?**

1. **Gaining initial access:** Attackers first need to compromise a system within the target network. This could be done through various techniques like phishing, malware, or exploiting vulnerabilities.
2. **Targeting service accounts:** Attackers identify accounts with Service Principal Names (SPNs) assigned. These accounts often have weak passwords due to their automated nature.
3. **Requesting TGS tickets:** Using compromised credentials, attackers request Kerberos tickets for services associated with the targeted SPNs.
4. **Extracting password hashes:** These tickets are encrypted with the password hash of the targeted service account. Attackers extract and crack the hash offline using specialized tools.
5. **Gaining unauthorized access:** Once the password is cracked, attackers can use it to access systems and data associated with the compromised account.

#### **What are the risks of Kerberoasting?**

* **Unauthorized access:** Stolen credentials can grant attackers access to sensitive data, systems, and resources within the network.
* **Lateral movement:** Once inside, attackers can use stolen credentials to move laterally across the network, escalating their privileges and expanding their reach.
* **Data breaches:** Stolen data can be used for further attacks, sold on the black market, or held for ransom.

#### **How can I prevent Kerberoasting?**

* **Implement strong password policies:** Enforce complex and unique passwords for all accounts, especially service accounts. Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
* **Minimize SPN assignments:** Only assign SPNs to accounts that strictly require them. Regularly review and remove unnecessary SPNs.
* **Enable Kerberos Armoring:** This encryption method enhances the security of TGS tickets, making them more resistant to cracking.
* **Monitor for suspicious activity:** Implement security monitoring solutions to detect unusual ticket requests and other signs of potential Kerberoasting attempts.
* **Regularly patch and update systems:** Ensure all systems and software are updated with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
