### Over-Pass-the-Hash

Pass-the-Hash (PtH) involves an attacker using a valid NTLM hash instead of a plain text password to authenticate to a networked service. The approach bypasses the need for the actual plaintext password, making it a powerful technique for lateral movement within a network following the initial compromise.

### Pass the Ticket

Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) is an attack method where attackers steal Kerberos tickets from a compromised system and then use those tickets to authenticate as the ticket's original owner. Unlike Pass-the-Hash, Pass-the-Ticket specifically targets the Kerberos authentication protocol used within Windows Active Directory environments.
