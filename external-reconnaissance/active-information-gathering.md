# Active Information Gathering

This step involves actively probing external systems and applications to collect information such as IP addresses, open ports, services running on each system, etc. This phase helps identify vulnerabilities by identifying potential attack vectors.

#### Active Probing in Vulnerability Assessment

Active probing is a critical step in the vulnerability assessment process. It involves:

* **Collecting Information**: Through active interaction with external systems and applications, this step gathers essential data like IP addresses, open ports, and the types of services each system runs.
* **Identifying Vulnerabilities**: By mapping out potential attack vectors, such as unsecured ports or outdated services, this phase pinpoints weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.

This proactive approach is pivotal for strengthening the security posture of an organization's network infrastructure.
