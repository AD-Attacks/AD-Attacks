Privilege Escalation through Windows Services Abuse

When an attacker gains access to a system with limited permissions, they may attempt to escalate their privileges to gain higher levels of access.&#x20;

One method to achieve this is by exploiting misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in Windows services.&#x20;

Windows services are programs that run in the background and have specific privileges based on their configuration and purpose. By abusing these services, an attacker could potentially elevate their privileges from a low-level user to an administrator or system-level user.&#x20;

This can be accomplished through various techniques, such as hijacking service binaries, exploiting insecure service permissions, or taking advantage of unpatched vulnerabilities in the service software.
