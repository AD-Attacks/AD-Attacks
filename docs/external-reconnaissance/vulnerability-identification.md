# Vulnerability Identification

This includes using vulnerability scanners and network scanners (such as Nessus, open vulnerability assessment system (OpenVAS), QualysGuard, etc.) to identify specific vulnerabilities present in the target system. It can help give an attacker insight as to what exploits and tools would be relevant against the system.
