# SessionGopher

#### Quietly digging up saved session information for PuTTY, WinSCP, FileZilla, SuperPuTTY, and RDP

SessionGopher is a PowerShell tool that finds and decrypts saved session information for remote access tools. It has WMI functionality built in so it can be run remotely. Its best use case is to identify systems that may connect to Unix systems, jump boxes, or point-of-sale terminals.
