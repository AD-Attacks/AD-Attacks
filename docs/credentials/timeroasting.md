# ðŸŸ¢ Timeroasting

Timeroasting takes advantage of Windows' NTP authentication mechanism, allowing unauthenticated attackers to effectively request a password hash of any computer or trust account by sending an NTP request with that account's RID.&#x20;

This is not a problem when computer accounts are properly generated, but if a non-standard or legacy default password is set this tool allows you to brute-force those offline.
